# ðŸŽ¨ awesome photoshop [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of Photoshop tips, techniques, and tutorials for photographers and beyond.

Some parts of this collection will be over-simplified. I will try to explain as much as you need to follow a particular technique, but will often leave out a deep and thorough understanding. When doing so, I will mark the section with the skeptical Colbert emoji `ðŸ¤¨`, leaving it as an exercise for the reader to research more on a topic they find interesting. If you feel like I have overly oversimplified, feel free to [open a new discussion](https://github.com/kirilvatev-photo/awesome-photoshop/issues/new) so we can get to the bottom of it.
